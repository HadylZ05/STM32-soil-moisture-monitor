#  Project Documentation

This directory contains the complete documentation for the **STM32 Soil Moisture Monitoring System** project.
The documentation is organized into three main sections to clearly separate hardware design, software implementation, and experimental results.
Together, these sections provide a complete and structured overview of the project, from physical setup to software design and final results.
